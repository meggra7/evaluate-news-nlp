# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing

## Objective
Build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites.


## Demonstrated Skills

### Webpack
The site is loaded and built through Webpack and NPM libraries.  The project includes unique development and production build modes, and includes the use of multiple loaders and plugins.  Refer to package.json for the full list of dependencies used.

### Sass
Styling has been written in Sass, including the use of features such as variables, nesting, modules, and inheritance.

### APIs, both internal and external
The project requires an internal call to the server script in order to securely insert the API key into external API calls.  Multiple API calls are then chained together to create a comprehensive analysis response that is returned and displayed in the browser.

### Service Workers
Service workers have been added to cache website data for improved performance in the event of poor or no internet connection.
